    "Web application frameworks, or simply \"web frameworks\", are the de facto way to build web-enabled applications.\n",
    "Web应用框架（或简称Web框架），是建立Web应用的方法。\n",
    "From simple blogs to complex AJAX-rich applications, every page on the web was created by writing code.\n",
    "无论是简单的博客，还是复杂的AJAX应用，每一个网页都是由代码生成的。\n",

    "\n",
    "Before we talk about frameworks, we need to understand how the web \"works\".\n",
    "在谈Web框架前，我们需要理解一下Web如何工作。\n",
    "To do so, we'll delve into what happens when you type a URL into your browser and hit Enter.\n",
    "我们将深入研究在浏览器里输入URL并按Enter后，将发生什么。\n",
    "Open a new tab in your browser and navigate to http://www.jeffknupp.com.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Web Servers and ... web ... servers...\n",
    "### Web服务器\n",
    "\n",
    "Every web page is transmitted to your browser as HTML, a language used by browsers to describe the content and structure of a web page.\n",
    "每一个网页都是通过HTML语言传输到你的浏览器里的，HTML是一种让浏览器描述网页内容、结构的语言。\n",
    "The application responsible for sending HTML to browsers is called a web server. Confusingly, the machine this application resides on is also usually called a web server.\n",
    "那些负责发送 HTML 到浏览器的应用称之为“Web 服务器”，会让你迷惑的是，运行“Web服务器”的设备通常也叫做Web服务器。\n",
    "\n",
    "The important thing to realize, however, is that at the end of the day, all a web application really does is send HTML to browsers.\n",
    "我们需要知道的最重要的事情是，所有Web应用的本质是发送HTML语言到浏览器。\n",
    "No matter how complicated the logic of the application, the final result is always HTML being sent to a browser (I'm purposely glossing over the ability for applications to respond with different types of data, like JSON or CSS files, as the concept is the same).\n",
    "无论应用的逻辑有多么复杂，最终的结果都是把HTML语言发送给浏览器（我故意忽略了Web应用还可以响应不同的数据格式，比如JSON、CSS，但是其本质都是一样的）。\n",

    "### HTTP\n",
    "### HTTP\n",
    "\n",
    "Browsers download websites from web servers (or \"application servers\") using the HTTP protocol (a protocol, in the realm of programming, is a universally known data format and sequence of steps enabling communication between two parties).\n",
    "浏览器通过HTTP协议从Web服务器（或者称应用服务器）下载网页内容，协议（在编程领域，指的是一种在2个部分，使用通用的数据格式、固定的执行顺序进行数据交换的方式）\n",
    "The HTTP protocol is based on a request-response model.\n",
    "HTTP协议的模型是“请求-反应”模型\n",
    "The client (your browser) requests data from a web application that resides on a physical machine. The web application in turn responds to the request with the data your browser requested.\n",
    "你的浏览器向运行在物理设备上的Web应用请求数据。Web应用依次返回浏览器请求的数据。\n",
    "\n",
    "An important point to remember is that communication is always initiated by the client (your browser).\n",
    "一个重要的事情是要记住，数据交换总是由浏览器（客户端）发起的。\n",
    "The server (web server, that is) has no way of initiating a connection to you and sending your browser unsolicited data.\n",
    "服务器（Web服务器）不会主动发起数据交换、不会给你的浏览器发送未请求的数据。\n",
    "If you receive data from a web server, it is because your browser explicitly asked for it.\n",
    "如果你从 web 服务器上接收到数据，一定是因为你的浏览器显示地发送了请求。\n",
    "\n",
    "### HTTP Methods\n",
    "### HTTP 方式\n",
    "\n",
    "Every message in the HTTP protocol has an associated method (or verb).\n",
    "每条传送的信息都有特定的方式。\n",
    "The various HTTP methods correspond to logically different types of requests the client can send, which in turn represent different intentions on the client side.\n",
    "不同的 HTTP 方法对应客户端可以发送的逻辑上不同类型的请求，反过来也代表了客户端的不同意图。\n",
    "Requesting the HTML of a web page, for example, is logically different than submitting a form, so the two actions require the use of different methods.\n",
    "例如，请求一个 web 页面的 HTML，与提交一个表单在逻辑上是不同的，所以这两种行为就需要使用不同的方法。\n",
    "\n",
    "### HTTP GET\n",
    "### HTTP GET方法\n",
    "\n",
    "The GET method does exactly what it sounds like: gets (requests) data from the web server.\n",
    "GET 方法就像其听起来的那样，从 web 服务器上 get（请求）数据。\n",
    "GET requests are the by far the most common HTTP request.\n",
    "GET 请求是到目前为止最常见的一种 HTTP 请求。\n",
    "During a GET request the web application shouldn't need to do anything more than respond with the requested page's HTML.\n",
    "在一次GET请求的过程中，Web应用除了返回请求的网页HTML外，不会做任何其他事情了。\n",
    "Specifically, the web application should not alter the state of the application as a result of a GET request (for example, it should not create a new user account based on a GET request).\n",
    "特别的，web 应用在 GET 请求的过程中，不应该改变应用的状态（例如，不会基于GET请求创建一个新用户）。\n",
    "For this reason, GET requests are usually considered \"safe\" since they don't result in changes to the application powering the website.\n",
    "正是因为这个原因，GET 请求通常认为是“安全”的，因为他们不会导致应用的改变。\n",
    "\n",
    "### HTTP POST\n",
    "### HTTP POST方法\n",
    "\n",
    "Clearly, there is more to interacting with web sites than simply looking at pages.\n",
    "显然，除了简单的查看页面之外，应该还有更多与网站进行交互的操作。\n",
    "We are also able to send data to the application, e.g. via a form.\n",
    "我们也能够向应用发送数据，例如通过表单。\n",
    "To do so, a different type of request is required: POST.\n",
    "为了达到这样的目的，就需要一种不同类型的请求方法：POST。\n",
    "POST requests usually carry data entered by the user and result in some action being taken within the web application.\n",
    "POST请求一般携带用户输入的数据，web 应用收到之后会产生一些行为。\n",
    "Signing up for a web site by entering your information on a form is done by POSTing the data contained in the form to the web application.\n",
    "网站上的注册功能，就是在表单中把你的信息输入完成，然后通过POST方法，把这些数据发送给web应用.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike a GET request, POST requests usually result in the state of the application changing.\n",
    "与GET不同的是，POST会改变Web应用数据。\n",
    "In our example, a new user account is created when the form is POSTed.\n",
    "在我们的例子中，当表单 POST 之后，一个新的账户被创建。\n",
    "Unlike GET requests, POST requests do not always result in a new HTML page being sent to the client.\n",
    "与GET不同的是，POST请求不总是生成一个新的 HTML 页面发送到客户端。\n",
    "Instead, the client uses the response's response code do determine if the operation on the application was successful.\n",
    "客户端根据响应的“响应状态码”做决定，例如：返回状态码200，代表服务器端操作成功，则客户端响应作出成功的操作。\n",
    "\n",
    "### HTTP Response Codes\n",
    "### HTTP响应码\n",
    "\n",
    "In the normal case, a web server returns a response code of 200, meaning, \"I did what you asked me to and everything went fine\".\n",
    "一般来说，Web服务器反馈一个响应码200，代表：“我已经做了你请求的事情，而且一切良好”。\n",
    "Response codes are always a three digit numerical code.\n",
    "响应码一般是3位数字。\n",
    "The web applications must send one with each response to indicate what happened as a result of a given request.\n",
    "web应用必须给每个请求都返回请求的处理结果。\n",
    "The response code 200 literally means \"OK\" and is the code most often used when responding to a GET request.\n",
    "响应状态码：200，意思是“OK”，通常用于响应GET请求。\n",
    "A POST request, however, may result in code 204 (\"No Content\") being sent back, meaning \"Everything went OK but I don't really have anything to show you.\"\n",
    "POST请求，可能接收到204（“没有内容”），意思是：“一起看起来没有问题，但是我还没有任何东西可以展示给你”。\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to realize that POST requests are still sent to a specific URL, which may be different from the page the data was submitted from.\n",
    "POST请求会创建一个特殊的URL，这个URL可能和提交数据的页面不同，意识这一点是至关重要的。\n",
    "Continuing our sign up example, the form may reside at www.foo.com/signup.\n",
    "继续说上面注册用户的例子，表单可能是在![](www.foo.com/signup)页面.\n",
    "Hitting submit, however, may result in a POST request with the form data being sent to www.foo.com/process_signup.\n",
    "点击submit,可能会导致带有表单数据的POST请求发送到![](www.foo.com/process_sigup)上.\n",
    "The location a POST request should be sent to is specified in the form's HTML.\n",
    "POST请求的地址，决定于**action**字段的值。也就是说：POST请求的地址，是由HTML页面中的字段决定的。\n",
    "\n",
    "### Web Applications\n",
    "### Web 应用\n",
    "\n",
    "You can get quite far using only HTTP GET and POST, as they're the two most common HTTP methods by a wide margin.\n",
    "你可以仅仅使用 HTTP GET 和 POST 做很多事情。GET和POST方法是两个最常见的HTTP方法\n",
    "A web application, then, is responsible for receiving an HTTP request and replying with an HTTP response, usually containing HTML that represents the page requested.\n",
    "Web应用责任是：接收的HTTP请求，并返回相应的HTTP响应，返回的请求结果通常包含HTML。\n",
    "POST requests cause the web application to take some action, perhaps adding a new record in the database. There are a number of other HTTP methods, but we'll focus on GET and POST for now.\n",
    "POST请求是让web应用做一些操作或者增加一条新的纪录到数据库。当然HTTP还有一些其他的方法，但是我们接下来只说GET和POST。\n",
    "\n",
    "What would the simplest web application look like?\n",
    "一个最简单的Web应用是什么样的呢？\n",
    "We could write an application that listened for connections on port 80 (the well-known HTTP port that almost all HTTP traffic is sent to).\n",
    "最简单的web应用是什么样？我们可以写一个监听80端口，等待连接（HTTP默认端口号就是80）的应用。\n",
    "Once it received a connection it would wait for the client to send a request, then it might reply with some very simple HTML.\n",
    "它建立连接，等待接收客户端发来的请求，接收到请求后，返回一些简单的HTML作为响应。\n",
    "Here's what that would look like:\n",
    "最简单的web应用代码：\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "import socket\n",
    "\n",
    "HOST = ''\n",
    "PORT = 80\n",
    "listen_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)\n",
    "listen_socket.bind((HOST, PORT))\n",
    "listen_socket.listen(1)\n",
    "connection, address = listen_socket.accept()\n",
    "request = connection.recv(1024)\n",
    "connection.sendall(\"\"\"HTTP/1.1 200 OK\n",
    "Content-type: text/html\n",
    "\n",
    "<html>\n",
    "    <body>\n",
    "        <h1>Hello, World!</h1>\n",
    "    </body>\n",
    "</html>\"\"\")\n",
    "connection.close()\n",
    "```\n",
    "(If the above doesn't work, try changing the PORT to something like 8080)\n",
    "(如果上面的代码不能运行，尝试把端口号(PORT)更换为8080)\n",
    "\n",
    "This code accepts a single connection and a single request.\n",
    "这段代码接收连接信号和请求信号。\n",
    "Regardless of what URL was requested, it responds with an HTTP 200 response (so it's not really a web server).\n",
    "不管请求任何的URL，它都回复HTTP 200响应（所以这段代码不是一个真正的web服务器）。\n",
    "The Content-type: text/html line represents a header field. Headers are used to supply meta-information about the request or response. In this case, we're telling the client that the data that follows is HTML (rather than, say, JSON).\n",
    "**Content-type:text/html** 行代码的是header字段，header用来提供请求或者响应的元信息。这样，我们就告诉了客户端接下来的数据是HTML。\n",
    "\n",
    "### Anatomy of a Request\n",
    "### 剖析Request请求\n",
    "\n",
    "If I look at the HTTP request I sent to test the program above, I find it looks quite similar to the response.\n",
    "如果看一下测试上面程序的HTTP请求，你会发现它和 HTTP 响应非常类似。\n",
    "The first line is <HTTP Method> <URL> <HTTP version> or, in this case, GET / HTTP/1.1.\n",
    "\n",
    "After the first line come a few headers like Accept: */* (meaning we will accept any type of content in a response). That's basically it.\n",
    "第一行<HTTP Method> <URL> <HTTP version>(HTTP方法，请求的URL，HTTP协议版本)，在这个例子中是 GET / HTTP/1.0。第一行之后就是一些类似Accept: */* 这样的头（意思是我们希望在响应中接收任何内容）。\n",
    "\n",
    "The reply we send has a similar first request line, in the format <HTTP version> <HTTP Status-Code> <Status-Code Reason-Phrase> or HTTP/1.1 200 OK in our case.\n",
    "响应和请求有着类似的第一行，格式是<HTTP version> <HTTP Status-code> <Status-code Reason Phrase>，在上面的例子中是HTTP/1.1 200 OK 。\n",
    "\n",
    "Next come headers, in the same format as the request headers.\n",
    "接下来是头部，与请求的头部有着相似的格式。\n",
    "Lastly, the actual content of the response is included.\n",
    "最后就是response包含的实际内容了。\n",
    "Note that this can be encoded as a string or binary object (in the case of files). The Content-type header lets the client know how to interpret the response.\n",
    "注意，这会被解释为一个字符串或者二进制文件， Content-type 头告诉客户端怎样去解释响应。\n",
    "\n",
    "### Web Server Fatigue\n",
    "### Web服务器还可以做点别的\n",
    "\n",
    "If we were going to continue building on the example above as the basis for a web application, there are a number of problems we'd need to solve:\n",
    "如果我们要在上面那个简单的web应用的基础上继续，搭建出一个web应用，我们还需要解决以下几个问题：\n",
    "\n",
    "1. How do we inspect the requested URL and return the appropriate page?\n",
    "1. 如何解析url使得，返回url对应的结果。（路由：route）\n",
    "2. How do we deal with POST requests in addition to simple GET requests\n",
    "2. 如何在支持GET的基础上，支持POST。\n",
    "3. How do we handle more advanced concepts like sessions and cookies?\n",
    "3. 如何处理cookie和session。\n",
    "4. How do we scale the application to handle thousands of concurrent connections?\n",
    "4. 如何处理上千的并发量。\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can imagine, no one wants to solve these problems each time they build a web application.\n",
    "没有人愿意每次建立web应用的时候都需要去处理这些问题。\n",
    "For that reason, packages exist that handle the nitty-gritty details of the HTTP protocol and have sensible solutions to problems the problems above.\n",
    "所以，就出现解决这些问题和HTTP协议的packages（包）。\n",
    "Keep in mind, however, at their core they function in much the same way as our example: listening for requests and sending HTTP responses with some HTML back.\n",
    "记住：这些包的核心方法我们上面的例子是一样的：监听端口，接收请求，返回HTTP响应和HTML。\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that client-side web frameworks are a much different beast and deviate significantly from the above description.\n",
    "注意：客户端的Web框架与上面的描述大不相同。\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solving The Big Two: Routing and Templates Of all the issues surrounding building a web application, two stand out.\n",
    "### 解决两个大问题：Routing(路由)和Templates(模版)\n",
    "\n",
    "    - How do we map a requested URL to the code that is meant to handle it?\n",
    "    - 我们如何将请求的 URL 映射到处理它的代码上？\n",
    "    - How do we create the requested HTML dynamically, injecting calculated values or information retrieved from a database?\n",
    "    - 如何根据处理完的结果，动态的生成请求的HTML？\n",
    "\n",
    "Every web framework solves these issues in some way, and there are many different approaches.\n",
    "每一个web框架解决这两个问题用的都是不同的方式，有许多不同的方法。\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples will be helpful, so I'll discuss Django and Flask's solutions to both of these problems. First, though, we need to briefly discuss the MVC pattern.\n",
    "举例子说明，应该跟有助于理解。所以，下面我们讲讨论：Django和Flask的解决这两个问题的方法。在此之前，我们需要简单的说一下MVC模式。\n",
    "\n",
    "### MVC in Django\n",
    "### Django里的MVC模式\n",
    "\n",
    "> Django makes use of the MVC pattern and requires code using the framework to do the same.\n",
    "MVC, or \"Model-View-Controller\" is simply a way of logically separating the different responsibilities of the application. Resources like database tables are represented by models (in much the same way a class in Python often models some real-world object). controllers contain the business logic of the application and operate on models. Views are given all of the information they needs to dynamically generate the HTML representation of the page.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Somewhat confusingly, in Django, controllers are called views and views are called templates. Other than naming weirdness, Django is a pretty straightforward implementation of an MVC architecture.\n",
    "Django 充分利用 MVC 设计模式。 MVC，也就是 Model-View-Controller （模型-视图-控制器），是一种将应用的不同功能从逻辑上划分开。models 代表的是类似数据库表的资源（与 Python 中用 class 来对真实世界目标建模使用的方法大体相同）。controls 包括应用的业务逻辑，对 models 进行操作。为了动态生成代表页面的 HTML，需要 views 给出所有要动态生成页面的 HTML 的信息。\n",
    "\n",
    "在 Django 中有点让人困惑的是，controllers 被称做 views，而 views 被称为 templates。除了名字上的有点奇怪，Django 很好地实现了 MVC 的体系架构。\n",
    "\n",
    "### Routing in Django\n",
    "### Django 中的路由\n",
    "Routing is the process of mapping a requested URL to the code responsible for generating the associated HTML. In the simplest case, all requests are handled by the same code (as was the case in our earlier example). Getting a little more complex, every URL could map 1:1 to a view function. For example, we could record somewhere that if the URL www.foo.com/bar is requested, the function handle_bar() is responsible for generating the response. We could build up this mapping table until all of the URLs our application supports are enumerated with their associated functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this approach falls flat when the URLs contain useful data, such as the ID of a resource (as is the case in www.foo.com/users/3/). How do we map that URL to a view function, and at the same time make use of the fact that we want to display the user with ID 3?\n",
    "\n",
    "Django's answer is to map URL regular expressions to view functions that can take parameters. So, for example, I may say that URLs that match ^/users/(?P<id>\\d+)/$ calls the display_user(id) function where the id argument is the captured group id in the regular expression. In that way, any /users/<some number>/ URL will map to the display_user function. These regular expressions can be arbitrarily complex and include both keyword and positional parameters.\n",
    "Routing in Flask\n",
    "\n",
    "Flask takes a somewhat different approach. The canonical method for hooking up a function to a requested URL is through the use of the route() decorator. The following Flask code will function identically to the regex and function listed above:\n",
    "\n",
    "@app.route('/users/<id:int>/')\n",
    "def display_user(id):\n",
    "    # ...\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, the decorator uses an almost simplified form of regular expression to map URLs to arguments (one that implicitly uses / as separators). Arguments are captured by including a <name:type> directive in the URL passed to route(). Routing to static URLs like /info/about_us.html is handled as you would expect: @app.route('/info/about_us.html')\n",
    "HTML Generation Through Templates\n",
    "\n",
    "Continuing the example above, once we have the appropriate piece of code mapped to the correct URL, how do we dynamically generate HTML in a way that still allows web designers to hand-craft it? For both Django and Flask, the answer is through HTML templating.\n",
    "\n",
    "HTML Templating is similar to using str.format(): the desired output is written with placeholders for dynamic values. These are later replaced by arguments to the str.format() function. Imagine writing an entire web page as a single string, marking dynamic data with braces, and calling str.format() at the end. Both Django templates and jinja2, the template engine Flask uses, are designed to be used in this way.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, not all templating engines are created equal. While Django has rudimentary support for programming in templates, Jinja2 basically lets you execute arbitrary code (it doesn't really, but close enough). Jinja2 also aggressively caches the result of rendering templates, so that subsequent requests with the exact same arguments are returned from the cache instead of expensively being re-rendered.\n",
    "Database Interaction\n",
    "\n",
    "Django, with its \"batteries included\" philosophy, includes an ORM (\"Object Relational Mapper\"). The purpose of an ORM is two-fold: it maps Python classes to database tables and abstracts away the differences between various database engines (though the former is its primary role). No one loves ORMs (because the mapping between domains is never perfect), rather, they are tolerated. Django's is reasonably full-featured. Flask, being a \"micro-framework\", does not include one (though it is quite compatible with SQLAlchemy, the Django ORM's biggest/only competitor).\n",
    "\n",
    "The inclusion of an ORM gives Django the ability to create a full-featured CRUD application. CRUD (Create Read Update Delete) applications seem to be the sweet spot for web frameworks (on the server side). Django (and Flask-SQLAlchemy) make the various\n",
    "CRUD operations for each model straightforward.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Web Framework Round-Up\n",
    "# Web框架总结\n",
    "\n",
    "By now, the purpose of web frameworks should be clear:\n",
    "到此为止，web框架到底做了什么就变得很清晰了：\n",
    "to hide the boilerplate and infrastructural code related to handling HTTP requests and responses.Just how much is hidden depends on the framework.\n",
    "把HTTP的请求和响应，根据特定的规则对应到具体的处理函数上。把处理完的结果，传递到模版引擎上。\n",
    "Django and Flask represent two extremes. Django includes something for every situation, almost to its detriment. Flask bills itself as a \"micro-framework\" and handles the bare minimum of web application functionality, relying on third-party packages to do some of the less common web framework tasks.\n",
    "Django和Flask是两个极端。Django包含了各种功能；Flask是‘微型框架’，只包含web框架的基本功能，但可以通过第三方包来扩充功能。\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, though, that at the end of the day, Python web frameworks all work the same way: they receive HTTP requests, dispatch code that generates HTML, and creates an HTTP response with that content. In fact, all major server-side frameworks work in this way (excluding JavaScript frameworks). Hopefully, you're now equipped to choose between frameworks as you understand their purpose.\n",
    "记住，Python web框架做的都是同样一件事情：接收HTTP请求，分配处理的方法，生成HTML作为HTTP响应，返回给客户端。实际上，几乎所有的web框架都是做了这些工作。但愿，你现在能够根据自己的需求，挑选最适合的框架了。\n"
